# AAUT-2021

Repository for the AAUT exam's exercises, session 2020-2021.

This repisotory is structured in 3 folders:

- `data`: containing the datasets for the exercises.
- `notebooks`: containing the Jupyter notebooks for the exercises. Each notebook is located in a folder with the name of the topic (for example: "tree-models", "linear-models").
- `scripts`: containing the notebook converted in python scripts.

Moreover, you can also find in fhe `enviroment.yml` file, my conda enviroment configuration.

1. [Naming convention](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/38305217/better-naming-convention-for-jupyter-notebook):
   This is really going to depend on your personal preferences, and use cases. Here is the approach I use
   `[#]_[2-4 word description]_[author-initials]_[ISO 8601 date].ipynb`
   for example:
   `1_exploratory_analysis_ag_2019-02-16.ipynb`
